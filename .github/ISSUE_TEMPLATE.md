### Are you looking for help?

This is an issue tracker, used to manage and track the development of Swagger Codegen - Play Scala. It is not a support system and so it is not a place to ask questions or get help. If you're not sure if you have found a bug, the best place to start is with [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/mohiva/swagger-codegen-play-scala). If you have a feature request, the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/mohiva/swagger-codegen-play-scala) is a better forum than an issue tracker to discuss it.
